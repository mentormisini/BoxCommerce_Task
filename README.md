I completed all acceptance criteria.

• Please create a mobile first PWA Angular app with at least 2 components, as follows:

• Support 2-way conversion i.e. allow the user to change values in either the from or to field

• The design of the code should support adding new units easily.

• The result should be displayed as user-friendly strings, for example ‘R250.00’, ‘$48.00’, ‘27 yd’ etc.

• Use Angular Material for basic styling (buttons, inputs etc).

• Use Angular Flex-Layout for basic template layout

• It should be a fully tested app.
